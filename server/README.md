# Auth Demo – Server (Express)

### Overview
This folder contains the Express server that demonstrates MDIP-based authentication, using Keymaster and Gatekeeper. It exposes `/api` routes for login, profile management, etc.

### Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
    - `npm install`

2. **.env configuration**
    - `AD_HOST_PORT=3000`
    - `AD_SERVE_CLIENT=true` (Whether to serve the client build or not)
    - `AD_CORS_SITE_ORIGIN=https://localhost:3001` (URL of remote client)
    - `AD_KEY_FILE=localhost-key.pem`
    - `AD_CERT_FILE=localhost.pem`
    - Additional variables like `AD_KEYMASTER_URL`, `AD_GATEKEEPER_URL`, `AD_WALLET_URL` for Keymaster/Gatekeeper integration.

3. **Run**:
    - `npm start`
      Starts the server at `https://localhost:3000`.

### Serving the Client
If `AD_SERVE_CLIENT=true` and you have built the React app (`npm run build` in client), this server will serve that `build/` folder for all non-API requests.

### CORS and Sessions
- This server uses `express-session` for session-based logins. Make sure to keep `credentials: true` if you want cross-origin cookies from your React dev server.

### Typical Endpoints
- `/api/challenge` – Creates an MDIP challenge for the user to scan or respond to.
- `/api/login` – Receives a DID response and logs the user in, setting session data.
- `/api/check-auth` – Checks if the user is logged in.
- Additional routes for profile, roles, etc.
